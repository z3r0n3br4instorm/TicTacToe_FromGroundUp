# TicTacToe_FromGroundUp
(Ongoing Incomplete Project !) Tictactoe game written in C from ground up, including the probability calculations

Prediction system isn't very optimal. And also took some shortcuts when coding it like placing the o randomly in the line(horizontal, vertical or diagonal) with the most probability.
It should and can be improved very much.
The part where the winner is determined is also not coded yet, so you can play the game even if you or the CPU won :)
